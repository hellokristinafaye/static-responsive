# static-responsive

Overview:

- A static, responsive web page built with HTML and CSS.
- Also an experiment on creating a repo on GH with the README already, and then cloning it into the local machine.  Pretty good, but we have forgotten a couple times to check the box.

Technologies Used:

- HTML
- CSS
  - scroll-behavior: smooth;
    - The tutorial originally had a link to a plug in on GitHub, that you probably had to download or use via CDN. That plugin has been deprecated and the note mentioned the above snippet that exists now and does everything it used to do and more.

Features:

Challenges:

Future Development:

- I probably won't develop this page any further, but may reference it in case future project require similar features.
